# SuperDARN-Uptime
This project provides scripts for fetching and processing SuperDARN experiment 
metadata and calculating basic statistics from these processed records.

A detailed log of events during fetching, parsing, and processing is maintained 
as well as a separately compiled list of SuperDARN .rawacf files which showed 
signs of data corruption or otherwise unusual behaviour.
